                I'm just a regular teenager who wants to make his own games. I'm 15 years old, I'm Ukrainian, and I started my career in the summer of 2024, so I've been in game development for about a year and a half now. In addition to game development, I am also interested in drawing, website creation, a little bit of editing, and a few other things. But I like creating games the most.
                <br><br>In game development, usually 2-3 people create a game because it is not easy to create a game alone, but for me, it is a very useful experience. Our team consists of 3-5 people (it hasn't been finalized yet). So far, I have been creating games on my own, without any help (well, except for the internet), and I'm really curious to know what it's like to work in a team (well, I'll find out soon).

        <section class="block">
            <h1 class="desc-section-title">My story (if anyone is interested)</h1>
            <p class="desc-text">
                My story began with the most banal thing—motivation. Sometime in the spring, I arrived from France, where I had spent a year or two (it was a terrible time). Day after day, I just lay on the couch, not really trying to change anything. I didn't have any friends to go out with, talk to in the fresh air, or just play something with when the sun was shining brightly. I only socialized in games. I didn't always sit at home; sometimes I went to the store, sometimes I walked with my family, sometimes I even did a little sports. I didn't think about the future, didn't think about what I would do, who I wanted to become. I just slept, woke up, ate, and slept again.
                <br><br>But one fine summer day, while scrolling through my TikTok feed, I came across a video. It didn't contain motivational phrases like, “If you lie around all the time, you won't achieve anything, so get your ass off the couch and start doing something.” I wasn't interested in that, I just kept scrolling. The video was very ordinary: a random schoolboy decided to get off the couch and start making games. He just showed what his game looked like, talked about what new features he had added, and that was it, nothing more. The author didn't talk about how cool it is to create games, how much money you can make from it, or why you should do it. He just showed his progress and that was it. But it motivated me so much that I wanted to try it myself, because I had dreamed of creating games since childhood. And of course, I followed his progress.
                <br><br>I went to Google to find out how to create games. I found a course on YouTube, downloaded Godot and a couple of other programs, and started doing something. But I didn't stay with Godot for long because I didn't like that you couldn't move the camera with the right mouse button. So I deleted it and decided to download Unity. Fortunately, it had that option. 
                <br><br>And if you think that I then sat down almost every day and learned how to develop games, you are very much mistaken. I was a typical teenager who only had motivation, which meant that I sat down for 6 hours every day for the first 2 weeks and then gave up. But somehow, I still managed to spend 6 hours a day for 1-3 days every 2 weeks. Although that's not how it should be; you shouldn't sit around and then start and give up for 2 weeks. Even studying for 1 hour every other day is much better than studying for 6 hours in one go.
                <br><br>Even though it was difficult to sit in Unity and then abandon it every two weeks, the training I chose with my initial knowledge made the task twice as difficult. When I looked at the 12-lesson course, I immediately started making my game, knowing the {create object} command.
                <br><br>And I chose such a complicated project. It was beyond my knowledge at the time, and I doubt I could have completed it in a year. But I decided to learn Unity by creating my own project. Of course, I couldn't come up with everything on my own, so YouTube courses helped me with that. I always tried to write the code myself. If it didn't work, I would work on it for two days and then use a neural network (it was a mistake not to do this right away). And when it couldn't solve a bug, I had to spend days trying to solve it myself (although I could have asked for help in one of the Telegram chats). But after a while, I realized that the project was beyond my level (it took me three months to realize this). Or maybe I just lost motivation to work on the project and started creating a new game instead.
                <br><br>I didn't abandon the new game for two weeks (a week at most). And I was able to finish it! But how I screwed up there, oh dear. After that, I started on a second project that was even better. The code is understandable (20%), and the project wasn't abandoned (3-4 days doesn't count). When I was already working on my third project, I met my buddy at a school chess competition, who also introduced me to his buddy, with whom we would create games together. I am so glad that I met them; it is one of the most important events in my life.             
                <br><br>While creating games, I also ran a video blog on TikTok about my progress, and I didn't have as many subscribers as the person who got me started in game development (I had less than 10, he had +-500). But you know what? I also inspired someone else to create games! How did I find out? He told me himself that he liked my projects, and we started talking. My videos were pretty awful, but there are people out there who don't necessarily need professional editing.
                <br><br>By getting off my ass and starting to do something, I gained knowledge that I can use to make money. I found friends who are really cool. My mindset has changed a lot. I stopped being shy, started to understand people, and stopped being afraid of being judged. I have two finished games from game development (and another one in development), 17 subscribers on Telegram (not many, but I have a lot of time). 
                <br><br>Overall, my life has become much better. I'm not insisting, but I strongly advise you to do what you want, whether it's game development or drawing anime, your efforts will definitely bear fruit. If you want, I can help you with this, even if only a little. Even doing something once a week is already the foundation of your career. And know that regular school can't always help you in life, so you have to achieve it yourself.
